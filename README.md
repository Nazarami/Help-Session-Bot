# Help-Session-Bot

## Why does this project exist?
Are you tired of constantly waiting *HOURS* on end for a UNSW help session booking? Have you been put on hold and been told to rebook another day?
Then I have the solution for you! Using Headless Chrome's Devtools, I have automated the process of selecting which computer science course to pick,
what you need help with, and relevant tag selection, as well as constantly refreshing and searching for your relevant help session booking.

## How does it compare to manual booking?
Depending on your computer's specs, Help-Session-Bot is able to book your help session in under 0.01 seconds. The majority of the time spent running the program is starting up an instance of Chromium. To ensure you're first in line, run the program a couple seconds before your help session is released, and let help-session-bot work its magic.
