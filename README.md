# Help-Session-Bot

## Why does this project exist?
Are you tired of constantly waiting *HOURS* on end for a UNSW help session booking? Have you been put on hold and been told to rebook another day?
Then I have the solution for you! Using Headless Chrome's Devtools, I have automated the process of selecting which computer science course to pick,
what you need help with, and relevent tag selection, as well as constantly refreshing and searching for your relevent help session booking.
